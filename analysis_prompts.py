GOAL: Extract and analyze all import/include statements from this code file for dependency tracking.

METHODOLOGY:
1. Identify all import statements (Python: import, from...import; JS: import, require; Java: import; etc.)
2. Categorize imports by type (standard library, third-party, local/relative)
3. Note any conditional or dynamic imports
4. Flag any deprecated or risky imports

GUARDRAILS:
- Only extract actual import statements, not comments about imports
- Include line numbers where possible
- Distinguish between different import types

GOAL: Analyze import patterns across the entire codebase to identify dependency issues and security risks.

INPUT DATA:

METHODOLOGY:
1. Cross-reference imports to detect missing dependencies
2. Identify unused imports within each file context
3. Map potential circular dependencies between files
4. Flag security-sensitive imports (subprocess, eval, exec, etc.)
5. Check for version conflicts in third-party dependencies

GUARDRAILS:
- Focus on actionable issues, not theoretical problems
- Prioritize security and stability concerns
- Consider project context when flagging issues

OUTPUT FORMAT (Structured Markdown):
## Import Analysis Summary

### Critical Issues
- List high-priority import problems

### Dependency Mapping
- Show key dependencies and their usage patterns

### Security Concerns
- Flag potentially dangerous imports

### Recommendations
- Actionable steps to improve dependency management

### Import Statistics
- Total imports, unique modules, dependency depth

GOAL: Identify code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and potential bugs in this code file.

METHODOLOGY:
1. Security analysis: SQL injection, XSS, command injection, hardcoded secrets
2. Performance issues: inefficient loops, memory leaks, blocking operations
3. Code quality: complexity, maintainability, naming conventions
4. Logic errors: null pointer risks, type mismatches, boundary conditions
5. Best practices: error handling, resource management, documentation

- Focus on realistic, exploitable security issues
- Consider performance impact in production context
